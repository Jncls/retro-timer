## How to use it?
* If the timer is not running you can enter the duration in seconds just by typing in numbers.
* By pressing 'Enter' you can start the timer.
* You can reset the timer with 'Backspace'.
* Press 'h' to show help window. (coming soon)

## Why another web timer application?
You may ask why I've built such an app by myself while there are a few alternatives out there. One reason is that I like programming and building stuff but the more important reason is that it turns out that it is very hard to find a free alternative where the team can focus on its task and not getting distracted by features or ad banners.

Although the primary target audience are scrum masters who need a tool like this in their agile meetings, I'm pretty excited to hear what other people my do with the app.

As the main feature is not getting distracted to let the team focus you might get disappointed when looking for a feature-rich stopwatch application.

## Development goals
* Simple and clean UI
* Shipped as a single HTML file with no dependencies
* Intuitive and easy to use
